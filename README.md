Original APi: Spotify API
Due to issues with continued access and permissions, a dataset containing Spotify data was pulled from Kaggle instead (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year)
Visualizations: The project visualizes Spotify's Top 50 Songs from 2010 for this first iteration of the app. The visualization is a bar chart which lists each song ordered by ranking, and details this energy level (Spotify API). 
The project uses D3.js and Chart.js for the visualization. 
The project uses a basic CSS framework with flex boxes and is mainly designed for easy usability
This portion of the project demonstrates the popularity of dance pop and energetic songs, and is an indicator of how current trends have remained the same over time.
